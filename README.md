# Artistic style transfer using Floydhub

Running deep learning projects can be a tedious job - installing the dependencies, downloading datasets, getting a gpu, etc.
To make things simpler, [Floydhub](https://www.floydhub.com) sets everything up for you.
In this project we'll be running a jupyter notebook on floydhub servers to do style transfer.

## Setup floydhub

Create an account on [Floydhub](https://www.floydhub.com)
Install the floyd-cli on your machine using `pip install -U floyd-cli`
Log in using the command line by running `floyd login`
Paste the authentication token from the site
*Now you are ready to go*
